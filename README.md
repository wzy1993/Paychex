Load original data and create features.ipynb ---- Load data, process and create behavior features

paychex_Profile related features.ipynb ---- Load datam process and create profile related features

Cluster.ipynb ---- Apply KNN to behavior features

using model for feature selection.ipynb	 ---- Get feature importance using XGBoost to select useful features

xgboost.ipynb ---- Try out XGBoost model

xgboost modeling with proper upsampling.ipynb ---- To avoid information leaks, we first split the dataset into a training dataset and test dataset, then upsample in the training set and keep the test set at the original size
